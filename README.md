# Retail Data Exploration

Welcome to  **Retail Data Exploration** ! This project focuses on analyzing retail data and implementing various visualizations to showcase insights and trends. The goal is to better understand customer behavior, sales patterns, and product performance using R.

## Project Status

ðŸš§  **Status** : `Completed!`

## Features

Here's an overview of the analysis and methods used in this project:

* **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning**
  * **Functionality:** Load and preprocess retail data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
  * **Visualization:** Summary statistics and distribution plots to explore sales and customer attributes.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  * **Functionality:** Perform data exploration to identify key insights in sales and customer behavior.
  * **Visualization:** Histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots to analyze data trends.
* **Retail Data Visualization**
  * **Functionality:** Create informative visualizations to better understand sales distribution, seasonal trends, and product performance.
  * **Visualization:** Line charts, heatmaps, and boxplots to display sales trends and variations.

## Technologies

This project is built using R and leverages the following libraries:

* **openxlsx** : A library for reading and writing Excel files.
* **ggplot2** : A powerful data visualization library for creating insightful plots and charts.

## Setup

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bayhaqieee/Retail_Data_Exploration.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd retail_data_exploration
   ```
3. Open RStudio and install required dependencies:
   ```r
   install.packages(c("openxlsx", "ggplot2"))
   ```
4. Run the analysis script:
   ```r
   source("retail_data_exploration.R")
   ```
5. Alternatively, you can run specific sections of the script by selecting and executing blocks of code.

## Live Visualization

For a more interactive experience, you can export the visualizations as PNGs or PDFs for further analysis and reporting.
